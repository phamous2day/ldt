##What is UX?
Our job is to make UX good/effective
1. Research to understand users
2. Develope ideas to solve users' needs
3. Measure solutions to see if they work

##Use Goals and Business Goals
Business goals are money, brand awareness, getting members, KPI's (key performance indicators)...how do you align business goals with user goals?

##5 Main ingrediants of UX
UX is more about how it works or artistic style
1. psychology
2. usability
3. design
4. copywriting
5. analysis

##User Research
What are you trying to learn about your users?

##How to ask Questions
1. Open question
2. Leading question
3. Closet/direct question

* interviews
* observations
* focus group
* surveys
* card-sorting

## User Profiles
(don't mistake this with demographics)

* goals
* expectations
* motivation
* behavior

##Designing for devices
1. how does it like to be interacted with?
2. start small — focus on content/core functionality
3. devices' special powers?
4. consider the software (mac, windows, linux)
5. be responsive
6. think about more than one screen at a time

##Information Architecture
To provide structure/organization to product ...  like make a site map. e.g.

Deep

=- ===

=- ===

=- ===

=- ===

VS

Flat
- --- -----------
- --- -----------
-- --- ----------

Focus on user, make sure they know where they are and where they can go

##Types of Information Architecture

* Categories
* Tasks
* Search
* Time
* People

##Wireframes
aka "blueprints"; a technical document that tells people how to build it ... NOT a quick sketch or mockup


##Visual Weight
* don't distract users from their goals
* controls where eyes go next
  * contrast * focus * depth & size
  
##Color
Wireframes are BW to focus on functionality; colors can have emotional meaning

##Repeition and pattern breaking
Whenever a pattern is broken, it attracts focus

##Line Tension
Our eyes follow/recognize patterns like a line of ducks or if the line of ducks are organized/outlined into shapes

##Alignment and Proximity
Closeness or distance between objects creates a feeling of these objects being related

###NY Code & Design UX Workshop notes
####Process Map
*Process can be quantified

* difference between process and insight

Empathy map

##Forms
can be a source of confusion, mistakes, and loss of engagement (I experienced this for homeadvisor.com)

1. Keep forms short as possible
2. Use many pages as you need but try to make it feel simple as possible
3. Different input types for different types of driven data collection
4. Preventing and handling mistakes: e.g. form validation for phone #'s

##Copywriting: CTA (calls to action), Instructions

A. Calls to Action
B. Instruments
C. Labels
D. Larger, persuasive text

##Primary & Secondary Buttons
Primary: register, buy, save, send, share, delete

Secondary: canceling, skip, reset, decline

##Conditioning — make a loop of feelings/behavior that never ends

using power design becaomes endlessly rewarding

Motivation -> Action -> Feedback -> Motivation

e.g. posting pics and getting LIKES+ ..............or how your tomagachi dies from neglect

##Persuasion and 8 Universal Ingrediants

Before interaction with users:

1. Credibility
2. Know your audience

During interaction with users:

3. Open & Disarm
4. Create Rapport
5. Isolate
6. Convince
7. Close the deal

After interaction
8. Summarize with bias


##How experiences change experiences
If you want millions of happy users, design for the distracted idiots not the obsessed geniuses

Paradox of choice: the more options seen, the less likely to choose any of them

Recognition vs Memory: use familiar icons vs new foreign itesm that take time to learn

Learning is slow. Habits are fast: onboarding from existing familiarity (like how almost all social media are built with similar interfaces).

##What is Data?

* It's Objective — it never lies
* Made of people
* More data is better

How to collect Objective data:

* analytics
* clickTale
* A/B Testing
* search logs
* eye-tracking

##Statistics
1&2: Sessions, users | Unique visits (high quality, high quantity)
3. page views
4. pages per visit
5. time per visit
6. bounce rate
7. new vs returning visits

##Designing with Data: Graph Shapes

2 graph styles that human behavior create often: traffic & structured behavior

##Designing with Data: A/B Tests

* Run both tests @ same time

* Best if only one detail is changed, not a bunch of details changed
